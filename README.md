ðŸ“„ Overview
This project involves building a predictive model to identify the key factors that drive first-day content viewership for an OTT (Over-The-Top) platform called ShowTime. The project was part of my Post Graduate Program in Data Science (PGPDS.O. MAR25.A).

The objective was to assist ShowTime in improving their content performance through data-driven insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement
With the increasing shift from traditional television to OTT platforms, understanding the factors that influence first-day content viewership is critical. The goal is to:

âœ” Identify the driving factors for first-day viewership
âœ” Build a reliable regression model to predict viewership
âœ” Provide actionable business recommendations

ðŸ—ƒ Dataset
The dataset includes:

Visitors: Average number of visitors (in millions)

Ad Impressions: Number of ad impressions (in millions)

Major Sports Event: Presence of major sports events on release day

Genre: Genre of the content

Day of the Week: Day of content release

Season: Season of release

Trailer Views: Number of trailer views (in millions)

Content Views: First-day content views (target variable, in millions)

ðŸ”§ Key Steps
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & Bivariate Analysis

Correlation Analysis

Data Preprocessing & Encoding

Model Building: Linear Regression

Model Evaluation & Assumptions Testing

Business Insights & Recommendations

ðŸ“Š Model Performance
RÂ² (Training): 78.9%

RÂ² (Test): 76.2%

RMSE (Test): 0.0511

MAE (Test): 0.0413

Model assumptions like linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity were successfully validated.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights
Visitors and trailer views significantly boost first-day content views

Releasing content on Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sundays leads to higher views

Major sports events negatively impact content viewership

Summer season shows the largest seasonal boost to views

ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Linear Regression (OLS)

âœ… Business Recommendations
Boost trailer campaigns before release

Plan content launches on high-viewership days

Avoid major sports event dates

Leverage seasonal trends for major content launches

Invest in acquiring platform visitors
