# Predictive-Modeling-Project-
TT First-Day Viewership Prediction - Linear Regression

Overview:
This project involves building a predictive model to identify the key factors that drive first-day content viewership for an OTT (Over-The-Top) platform called ShowTime. The project was part of my Postgraduate Program in Data Science (PGPDS.O.MAR25.A).

The objective was to assist ShowTime in improving its content performance through data-driven insights.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:
With the increasing shift from traditional television to OTT platforms, understanding the factors that influence first-day content viewership is critical. The goal is to:

âœ” Identify the driving factors for first-day viewership
âœ” Build a reliable regression model to predict viewership
âœ” Provide actionable business recommendations

ðŸ”§ Key Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate & Bivariate Analysis
Correlation Analysis
Data Preprocessing & Encoding
Model Building: Linear Regression

ðŸ“Š Model Performance:
RÂ² (Training): 78.9%
RÂ² (Test): 76.2%
RMSE (Test): 0.0511
MAE (Test): 0.0413
Model assumptions like linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and absence of multicollinearity were successfully validated.

ðŸ’¡ Key Insights:
Visitors and trailer views significantly boost first-day content views
Releasing content on Wednesdays, Saturdays, Sundays leads to higher views
Major sports events negatively impact content viewership
Summer season shows the largest seasonal boost to views

âœ… Business Recommendations:
Boost trailer campaigns before release
Plan content launches on high-viewership days
Avoid major sports event dates
Leverage seasonal trends for major content launches
Invest in acquiring platform visitors
